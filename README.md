# Flexi-Blender

Flexi-Blender is a Python script that facilitates the integration of 3D matrix data from a CSV file to animate a character within a Blender environment. It's an essential tool for animators and Blender enthusiasts looking for an efficient way to incorporate complex data structures into their projects.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll first need to set up your environment correctly and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/flexitrace/flexi-blender.git

python


2. Open the Blender application and load the `model.blend` file from the cloned repository.

3. Before running the main script, execute the `setup_env.py` script within Blender to install the required `pandas` package. You can do this by opening the script in Blender's text editor and running the script (or by using the built-in Python console).
```python
import pip
pip.main(['install','pandas~=2.1.0'])

Usage

Once the environment is set up, you can use the csv_to_animation.py script to animate your character with the 3D matrix data from the sample.csv file. Here's how to use the script:

    Load the csv_to_animation.py script in Blender's text editor.
    Run the script. This script reads data from the sample.csv file and uses it to animate the character in the model.blend file.

Script Details

Here's a brief explanation of the main components of the csv_to_animation.py script:

    LOC_OR_GLOB: Specifies whether the transformations are in local or global coordinates.
    OBJECT_NAME: The name of the object to be animated.
    ARMATURE_NAME: The name of the armature controlling the object.
    CSV_FILE: The path to the CSV file containing the animation data.
    MATRIX_LOC_OR_GLOB: Specifies which coordinate system (local or global) to use from the LOC_OR_GLOB list.

Function

    csv_to_animation2(obj, arm, csv_file, loc_or_glob): This function takes the object name, armature name, CSV file path, and coordinate system as arguments, and animates the character based on the data in the CSV file.
